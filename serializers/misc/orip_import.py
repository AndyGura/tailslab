"""ORIP geometry (TNFS car models in CFM, track props in FAM) built from an OBJ + MTL, the inverse of what
`OripGeometrySerializer` exports: the polygons of the OBJ replace the ones of the ORIP loaded in the file, and what an
OBJ cannot hold is taken from that ORIP (the "current" one) or derived from the geometry:

- OBJ quads stay quads, bigger faces are split in triangles; in an OBJ made of triangles only (older exports, editors
  that triangulate), triangle pairs (0, 1, 2) + (0, 2, 3) (or (0, 2, 1) + (0, 3, 2) for `flip_normal`) are quads.
  Two-sided polygons come from a polygon followed by its reverse. Texture coordinates equal to the corners of the
  texture are written as a polygon without `use_uv`, as the export makes them, with the corner order and
  `flip_normal` they tell. A flipped polygon with `use_uv` comes back reversed, without `flip_normal`: the export
  writes it starting at its second corner, so its first two corners, which the game sorts polygons by, stay the same.
  The faces listed in `orip_faces` of the extras file (by mesh, as corner positions) get the corner order and
  `flip_normal` back, so the game's painters draw them exactly as before (they depend on the corner order), and their
  order: polygons in ORIP order, then new ones; partition lists in their order (the game draws polygons of equal
  depth in it), then new ones
  Line polygons, chains and `alt_rasterizer` are not exported, so not imported
- labels and partitions from the mesh names ("lbl__<label>__<texture>", "__<partition>" suffix,
  `orip_sub_mesh_names`); the main partition of a mesh from the `objects` of "<obj name>_extra.json", else from the
  mesh of that name in the current ORIP, else wheel quads go to `outside`, other polygons to `surface`
- textures from the MTL: the material name when it is a FSH bitmap name (4 bytes at most, as the export names them;
  "<bitmap>__cutout" / "<bitmap>__opaque" set the colour key bit 0x08), else the file name of its `map_Kd` texture. A
  material without `map_Kd`, with `Kd`, of no bitmap of the FSH (the export's "flat_<rrggbb>") is a flat colour
  polygon, with the current material of that colour when there is one. UVs are scaled to texels with the size of the
  `map_Kd` image, else of the FSH bitmap
- material fields (names like `frntires`, colours) and the colour key / textured bits of the polygon type from the
  current polygons with the same texture (unless the material name sets the colour key), colour key of a new texture
  from the alpha of its PNG; materials no polygon uses (`tire1`..`tire4`, `pal`) are kept
- `fx_polys`: the wheel ground points `FL0`..`RR1` are the bottom corners of the wheel quads (labels `lt_frnt`...),
  the others are put at the position of the dummy "fx_<name>" of the extras file, else stay where they are in the
  current ORIP
- morphs: kept when all their moved vertices are still there, else made again for the front wheel quad and its `circ`
  quad, turned by 30 degrees (about weight 1.0 in the game)"""
