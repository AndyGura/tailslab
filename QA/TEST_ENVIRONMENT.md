# Test Environment

## The core problem this file solves

This app's GUI cannot be driven by browser automation (e.g. a Chrome-extension-based agent tool)
in any of its normally-documented run modes:

- **macOS / Windows** (any mode, including `--dev`): the GUI is a **native web view**
  (`pywebview`/WKWebView or WebView2) — not a Chrome tab. No browser-automation tool can attach to
  it.
- **Linux, production mode**: opens a dedicated **Chromium app window** (`eel.start(..., mode=
  'chrome-app'-equivalent)`) — needs a real Chrome/Chromium binary, and is still a separate app
  window rather than a normal tab in most automation setups.
- **Linux, `--dev` mode**: opens **no window at all** — it only starts the backend on port 8000
  for the Angular dev server's proxy to reach. This is the one mode where a real browser tab
  pointed at `http://localhost:4200` gets a **fully functional** app (confirmed live — real
  backend calls, real parsing, real rendering), because Linux drives the whole bridge through the
  actual `Eel` Python library over a plain WebSocket, which any browser can speak.

**Conclusion**: to interactively test this GUI with browser automation, run it via the Linux
`--dev` flow, in a real browser, regardless of what platform the person/agent doing the testing is
actually on. The recipe below does this inside Docker so it doesn't require a native Linux
machine.

## Recipe: a drivable instance via Docker

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.14-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl gnupg ca-certificates && \
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash - && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nodejs && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["bash"]
```

```bash
docker build -t nfs-qa-linux -f Dockerfile .
docker run -d --name nfs-qa -p 4200:4200 -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/nfs-resources-converter:/app -w /app nfs-qa-linux bash -lc "sleep infinity"

docker exec nfs-qa bash -lc "python -m venv /opt/venv && /opt/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt"
docker exec nfs-qa bash -lc "cd frontend && npm install"

# Backend (Eel dev server on :8000)
docker exec -d nfs-qa bash -lc "/opt/venv/bin/python run.py --dev > /tmp/backend.log 2>&1"
# Frontend (Angular dev server on :4200, proxies /eel and /resources to :8000)
docker exec -d nfs-qa bash -lc "cd frontend && npm run start -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200 > /tmp/ng.log 2>&1"
```

Then point real Chrome (e.g. via the `claude-in-chrome` MCP tools) at `http://localhost:4200/`.
Give the Angular dev server ~15-20s to finish its first compile before navigating.

**Why bind-mount the whole repo instead of copying it in**: `require_file`/`convert` calls made
from inside the container need to resolve paths like `/app/test/golden_corpus/AL1.TRI` — mount the
repo at `/app` and use container-relative paths (`/app/...`) everywhere you type a path into the
GUI, since the browser-side JS has no idea it's talking to a container.

### Driving native Open/Save/Select-Directory dialogs headlessly

These three RPCs (`open_file_dialog`, `save_file_dialog`, `select_directory_dialog`) fall back to
**Tkinter** on Linux (no pywebview window to own a native dialog) — see
`api/endpoints/file_dialog_api.py`. Tkinter needs a real X11 display, which a bare container
doesn't have. Two things you need on top of the base recipe:

```bash
docker exec nfs-qa bash -lc "apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq xvfb xdotool tk"
docker exec -d nfs-qa bash -lc "Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1280x1024x24 -nolisten tcp"
# restart the backend with DISPLAY set so Tkinter has somewhere to draw:
docker exec -d nfs-qa bash -lc "export DISPLAY=:99; /opt/venv/bin/python run.py --dev > /tmp/backend.log 2>&1"
```

Then, after clicking the real "Open File" (or Browse/Save-as) button in the browser — which opens
the Tk dialog on the virtual display — drive the dialog **from the shell, not the browser** (there
is no way to screenshot/interact with an off-screen X11 window through browser-automation tools):

```bash
docker exec nfs-qa bash -lc "export DISPLAY=:99; xdotool search --name ." # find the dialog window id
docker exec nfs-qa bash -lc "export DISPLAY=:99; xdotool windowfocus <id>; \
  xdotool key ctrl+a; xdotool type --delay 20 '/app/test/golden_corpus/AL1.TRI'; xdotool key Return"
```

`xdotool windowactivate` fails with *"windowmanager claims not to support _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW"*
under bare Xvfb (no window manager running) — use `windowfocus` instead, which doesn't need one.
Typing a full valid path into Tk's `askopenfilename`/`asksaveasfilename` and pressing Return
submits it directly, without needing to navigate the file browser widget.

**This genuinely round-trips through the real button click and the real backend RPC** — confirmed
live by opening `AL1.TRI` this way and observing the correct window title, real
`/resources/.../terrain_chunk_N.obj` HTTP requests in the backend log, and the real TRI 3D viewer
rendering. This is meaningfully different from (and more trustworthy than) calling
`eel.open_file(path)()` directly from the browser console: that reaches the Python endpoint and
gets real data back, but **does not update the Angular UI**, because the UI-side state
(`openedResourcePath$` etc.) is set by the TypeScript wrapper around that call
(`ApiDelegateImplService`), not by the raw RPC response — bypassing the button bypasses that
wrapper too. Use the real dialog-automation technique above whenever the test needs to assert
anything about UI state, not just backend behavior.

### Shortcut: driving it directly on the host, no Docker (when you just need one screenshot)

The Docker recipe above is the right call for a real regression pass, but it's overkill for the
common "I just changed a GUI component, show me it renders" case — you don't need a genuine Linux
box for that, because `actions/gui_editor_linux.py` is **plain, platform-agnostic Python**: nothing
in it actually depends on being on Linux, it just isn't the branch `run.py` dispatches to on
macOS/Windows (that dispatch is a `sys.platform` check in `run.py`, not a capability difference).
You can import and call it directly, on macOS or Windows, and get the exact same drivable
`http://localhost:4200` tab as the Docker recipe, with no container at all:

```bash
# from the repo root, with the Angular dev server already running (npm run start, inside frontend/)
./.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import actions.gui_editor_linux as g
g.run_gui_editor('test/golden_corpus/SOME_FILE.EXT', dev_server_url='http://localhost:4200')
EOF
```

This is **confirmed live** (used to verify the NFS4 track viewer end-to-end, screenshot included in
that session). Two things to know before reaching for this:

- **Passing a `file_path` auto-opens it — no dialog, no click needed.** `run_gui_editor` forwards it
  into `API(static_path, file_path)`, which pushes it to the frontend via the same
  `open_arg_file`/`on_angular_ready` handshake real file-association opens use, as soon as Angular
  signals ready. This sidesteps the whole Tk/Xvfb/`xdotool` dance below entirely for the "just show
  me this one file" case — only reach for the dialog-automation recipe if the scenario specifically
  needs to exercise the Open/Save dialog itself.
- **Port conflicts are your problem to solve, not the app's.** `_DEV_SERVER_PORT` in
  `gui_editor_linux.py` (and `_DEV_STATIC_SERVER_PORT` in `gui_editor_macos.py`, if you ever do need
  the native-window path for something) is hardcoded to `8000`, matching
  `frontend/src/proxy.conf.json`'s proxy target — there's no env var or CLI override. If something
  else on the host already owns 8000 (observed once: an unrelated `pocket-ic` process, nothing to do
  with this repo), **don't edit either Python file** — monkeypatch the module attribute in your
  throwaway script instead (`g._DEV_SERVER_PORT = 8001`), and temporarily point
  `frontend/src/proxy.conf.json`'s two `target` values at the same port, restarting `ng serve` so it
  picks up the change. Revert `proxy.conf.json` (`git checkout -- frontend/src/proxy.conf.json`)
  once you're done — it's a tracked file and the port swap has no reason to survive your session.
  Check for the conflict first with `lsof -nP -iTCP:8000 -sTCP:LISTEN`.

To switch files, kill the backend and start it again with the new path, then reload the tab (confirmed live
2026-10-15). With `ng serve`, `window.ng` works, so an import (Deserialize) can skip the file dialog:
`const c = ng.getComponent(document.querySelector('app-font-block-ui')); await c.mainService.deserializeResource(c.resourceId, [paths...])`
(any block component has `mainService` and `resourceId`). This goes through the same Angular service as the
button, so the changes list, the error dialog and the editor update as usual.

**Don't bother with macOS `screencapture`/AppleScript for this.** The instinct, when you already
have a live GUI window open via `python run.py --dev` (native pywebview path), is to just screenshot
the window directly rather than bothering with the Eel/browser route above. In an agent sandbox this
reliably dead-ends: `screencapture` fails outright (`could not create image from display` — no
Screen Recording permission for the process), and `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events"
...'` hangs waiting on an Accessibility permission prompt nothing can dismiss non-interactively.
Neither permission can be granted headlessly. Skip straight to the no-Docker shortcut above instead
of spending time on either — it gets you a real screenshot via the `computer` MCP tool's own
capture, which needs no OS-level permission at all.

### Headless screenshots in a cloud container (no browser tools at all)

When the session has no browser-automation tools (claude.ai cloud container), drive the same
`http://localhost:4200` tab with Playwright and the preinstalled Chromium. WebGL (every 3D viewer)
only renders with SwiftShader flags; without them the canvas stays blank and nothing errors:

```python
# shot.py <out.png> <wait_ms>
import sys, asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright


async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as p:
        b = await p.chromium.launch(
            executable_path='/opt/pw-browsers/chromium',
            args=['--no-sandbox', '--use-gl=angle', '--use-angle=swiftshader', '--enable-unsafe-swiftshader'],
        )
        pg = await b.new_page(viewport={'width': 1400, 'height': 1000})
        logs = []
        pg.on('console', lambda m: logs.append(f'{m.type}: {m.text}'))
        await pg.goto('http://localhost:4200/')
        await pg.wait_for_timeout(int(sys.argv[2]))  # a whole NFS6/NFS4 track needs ~60-90s
        await pg.screenshot(path=sys.argv[1])
        print('\n'.join(logs[-30:]))
        await b.close()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Start the backend with the no-Docker shortcut above (the file argument auto-opens it), run the script,
and look at the PNG with the Read tool. To check another file, restart the backend with the new path.
Interact through ordinary selectors (e.g. `pg.fill('input[type=number]', '250')` for a track viewer's
"Spline item" fly-to). Print the console log every time: a texture 404 or a backend `Traceback` usually
shows up there before it shows up in the picture.

- The container's Node may be older than `frontend/package.json`'s `engines` range; `npm install
  node@24` into a scratch directory and put its `node_modules/.bin` first on `PATH`.
- Stop the servers with a pattern that can't match your own shell's command line
  (`pkill -f "ng serve"` inside a command that also contains "ng serve" kills that command itself):
  use `pgrep`, then `kill` by PID.

### Checking edited TNFS car files in the physics engine (tnfs-1995)

To see what a PBS / PDN edit does to the car, drive the saved file in `../tnfs-1995` headlessly: compile its `*.c`
except `tnfs_sdl_main.c` as one unit (`#include` them, with `tnfs_sfx_play` renamed as in nfs-web's
`tnfs-physics.c`) plus a `main` that calls `tnfs_init_sim(tri, pbs)`, sets `g_total_cars_in_scene = 1` (traffic
otherwise hits the player), and loops `tnfs_update()` setting `g_control_throttle` / `g_control_brake` /
`g_control_steer` / `g_control_gear` (shifting works from `iSimTimeClock` 300). The port reads **uncompressed**
files: decode the saved file with the games' ASM decoders (`Qfs3ASMCompression` etc. in
`test/resources/eac/archives/test_compressed_block.py`) rather than the converter's Python decoder. AI cars read
`carspecs.pdn` from the working directory. A straight open TRI is easy to generate from `read_tri_file`'s layout
(header byte 0x11, nodes at 0x98C × 36 bytes, speed table at 0x15B0C, prop counts at 0x16214).

### Known friction with this setup

- `computer` screenshot capture can hang (CDP `Page.captureScreenshot` times out) on a tab that
  has hosted a 3D/WebGL viewer, even after navigating away within the same tab — see
  `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` KI-3. Open a fresh tab rather than retrying.
- `window.ng` (Angular DevTools globals) is unavailable — see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` KI-2 — so you
  cannot grab a component instance from the console to drive it directly; drive through real
  clicks/`eel.*` RPCs instead.
- Angular Material menus re-measure between renders; a coordinate from a screenshot taken even a
  moment earlier can be stale. Prefer `find` + click-by-ref for menu items.
- The MCP browser tab group can silently disappear after closing what looks like a non-last tab
  (observed once, cause not identified) — if `tabs_context_mcp` reports no group, just recreate
  one with `createIfEmpty: true` and re-navigate.

## Recipe: headless corpus/library testing (no GUI needed at all)

For anything that's really a **parsing library** question rather than a **GUI** question, skip
Docker/Xvfb entirely — run straight on the host:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import os
from library import require_file

corpus = 'test/golden_corpus'
files = sorted(f for f in os.listdir(corpus) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(corpus, f)) and not f.startswith('.'))
bad = []
for f in files:
    path = os.path.join(corpus, f)
    try:
        name, block, data = require_file(path)
        if isinstance(data, dict) and 'error_class' in data:
            bad.append((f, 'error-block', data.get('error_text')))
            continue
        block.pack(data, name=name)  # write round-trip
    except Exception as e:
        bad.append((f, type(e).__name__, str(e)))
print(f"{len(files)} files, {len(bad)} problems")
for b in bad:
    print(' -', b)
EOF
```

Every file in `test/golden_corpus/` is expected to be **fully supported** — any failure here is a
regression, full stop (see `test/test_gui_golden_corpus.sh` for the existing manual/visual
counterpart of this same corpus, and `TEST_HISTORY.md` for the last run's result). Some parsers
print internal caught-exception tracebacks to stderr as part of normal control flow (e.g. an enum
fallback path in `library/read_blocks/delegates.py`) — these are noise, not failures; only trust
the script's own `bad` list.

For the much larger, git-ignored `games/` directory (full real game installs — not tracked in git,
personal/local only), see `test/resources/test_games_directory.py` (currently
`@unittest.skip`'d because it's slow — a few minutes over ~8,000 files). **If you add a file from
`games/` to any git-tracked test fixture location (e.g. `test/golden_corpus/`), copy it in
explicitly** — `games/` itself is `.gitignore`d, so referencing a path under it from a checked-in
test would break for anyone else who clones the repo.

## Build/launch reference (for completeness — see root `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md` for full detail)

- Python **3.14**, venv at `./.venv`; `./.venv/bin/python -m unittest` for the backend suite.
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`; `npm run start` (dev server on :4200); `npm run build`
  (production bundle to `frontend/dist/gui`).
- `python run.py` — production GUI; `python run.py --dev [--dev-server URL]` — dev GUI;
  `python run.py convert <in> --out <out>` — headless converter; `python run.py show_settings` —
  print the settings file path; `python run.py uncompress <file>` — decompress a QFS-family file.
- `ffmpeg` and Blender 4+ are optional; their absence degrades specific conversion options rather
  than failing the app (confirmed live, see `APPLICATION_MAP.md`).
- No secrets/credentials are involved anywhere in this app — it's a local file-processing tool.
