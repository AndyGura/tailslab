# NFS6 (Hot Pursuit 2) track is a folder: "compNN.o" files are the track compartments (sections), "persist.viv"
# holds the textures of them ("track.fsh"), and every "levelNN" sub-folder is one race route. Its "drvpath.ini" lists
# compartments the route goes through, "levelG.o" and "level.fsh" are the route props (signs, barrels, spike strips,
# helicopter) and their textures, "level.dat" places them (not supported yet), and "aipaths.dat" is the road graph
# described here. See `EaglModel` in `resources/eac/geometries/nfs6.py` for the
# geometry files.
